# Audio System Issues

## Current Status
- Audio files load but don't play in browser
- MP3 files corrupted (0-96 bytes)
- WAV files are valid (4KB-88KB) but playback fails
- Browser shows audio support but actual playback doesn't work

## Attempted Fixes
1. Switched from MP3 to WAV files
2. Simplified audio manager
3. Added proper MIME types
4. Removed autoplay restrictions

## Known Issues
- Web Audio API causes browser freeze
- Audio elements create but play() silently fails
- No actual sound output despite successful file loading

## TODO
- Investigate browser-specific audio policies
- Try different audio formats (OGG)
- Consider using a proper audio library
- Test in different browsers/systems
